#Challenge

#1.) Print three different strings
print("string one")
print("another string")
print("the last string")

#2.) Write a program that prints a message if a variable is less than 10, and 
#    different message if the variable is greater than or equal to 10
x = int(input("pick a number between 1 and 20: "))

if x >= 10:
    print("x is greater than or equal to 10")
else:
    print("x is less than 10")

#3.) Write a program than prints a message if a variable is less than or equal 
#    to 10, another message if the variable is greater than 10 but less than or
#    equal to 25, and another message if the variable is greater than 25


#4.) Create a program that divides two variables and prints the remainer


#5.) Create a program that takes two variables, divides them, and prints the quotient


#6.) Write a program with a variable 'age' assigned to an integer that prints
#    different strings depending on what integer 'age' is
