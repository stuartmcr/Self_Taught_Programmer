#Challenges

#1.) Create a list of your favorite musicians


#2.) Create a list of tuples, with each tuple containing the longitude
#    and latitude of somewhere you've lived or visited


#3.) Create a dictionary that contains different attributes about
#    you: height, favorite color, favorite author, etc.


#4.) Write a program that lets the user ask your height, favorite color, or
#    favorite author, and returns the result from the dictionary you created 
#    in the previous challenge


#5.) Create a dictionary mapping your favorite musicians to a list of your
#    favorite songs by them


#6.) Lists, tuples, and dictionaries are just a few of the containers built
#    into Python. Research Python sets. When would you use a set?
