#Challenge

#1.) Write a function that takes a number as an input and returns that number squared
def f(x):
    return x**2

value = int(input("give me a number between 3 and 9: "))
y = f(value)
print(y)

#2.) Create a function that accepts a string as a parameter and prints it
def g(a):
    return str(a)

string = input("your fav animal is: ")
z = g(string)
print(z)


#3.) Write a function that takes three required parameters and two optional parameters


#4.) Write a program with two functions. The first function should take an integer
#    as a parameter and return the result of the integer divided by 2. The second
#    function should take an integer as a parameter and return the result of the 
#    integer multiplied by 4. Call the first function, save the result as a 
#    variable, and pass it as a parameter to the second function


#5.) Write a function that converts a string to a float and returns the result. Use
#    exception handling to catch the exception that could occur


#6.) Add a docstring to all of the functions you wrote in challenges 1-5
